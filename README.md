# 🧵 AI Marketing Assistant for Moroccan Artisans 🇲🇦

This project is an intelligent assistant designed to help traditional Moroccan artisans promote their products on social media. It uses multimodal AI (text and image understanding) to generate high-quality marketing content and publish it automatically on Facebook — all with minimal digital skills required.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Many artisans in Morocco, especially in rural areas, face challenges in promoting their handmade products due to:
- Low digital literacy
- Limited access to marketing tools
- Language barriers (Darija, Arabic, French)

This assistant helps them generate and post compelling product descriptions by simply:
1. Uploading a photo
2. Writing a short message in **Darija**, Arabic, French, or English

The assistant then creates a full social media post using AI and publishes it directly to their Facebook page.
